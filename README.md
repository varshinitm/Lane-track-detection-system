# Lane-track-detection-system

ABSTRACT:

  Road safety has long been a major issue for many people worldwide, and since automobiles and computers were joined to make driving safer and more effective, technologies that assist drivers have been developed. Many systems are available to alert drivers to various threats, including as lane departure, potential collisions, and different traffic signs. Modern technologies, such as the emerging OPEN-CV vision, allow us to construct far more efficient systems, so there is still an opportunity for improvement. Additionally, the detections can be made better so that they work better in a variety of scenarios, including varied lighting conditions and high-quality roads. 
It is created using Python programming and OpenCV (Deep Learning).
